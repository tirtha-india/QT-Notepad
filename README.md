# QT-Creator_Notepad
## How to run the code
You have to install QT creator (Latest LTS version) from the https://www.qt.io/download site and then open the files in the code editor of this software and then need to build the files and run the code in QT. Then you can see the Notepad running in your computer.
## What has been done 
I have made a simple GUI app using QT and used C++ as the base language. This Notepad has the basic features and can run in Windows 10 prefectly.
## Issues/Challenges
The main challenge was to understand the QT creator itself and where to add what? Like how to make the UI and stuffs and how to add click functions on them. what are the logics I should use in the functions. But after I invested a good ammount of time in it I could solve the issues.
## Features
1. Bold/Unbold - The Notepad has a dedicated bold/unbold feature in it. The unbold feature is not directly there but you can undo the bold lines if you want to unbold it and again redo to bold it.
2. SuperScript/SubScript - The Notepad consists of this feature which allows the user to make a super or sub script text. eg, A<sup>2</sup> and A<sub>2</sub>
3. Save/Save As - User can save the new file using Save As and save a new change in an already existing file using Save feature.
4. Fonts - User can chose their favourite fonts and the size using this feature.
5. Undo/Redo - User can make changes to the text and then undo if they do not like the change or redo if they think the change was right.
6. Open/New - user can open an existing file using Open function and use the New function to create a new text file.

PS - All the above functions can be found in the Menu bar located in the top part of the Notepad Editor.
